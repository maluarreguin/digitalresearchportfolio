I have long felt that these two sectors coincide quite naturally, and that the merging between them that I have undertaken allows for a greater and more nuanced perspective for both information professionals and digital humanists such as myself.</p><p>Having always carried a love of libraries but in conjunction an interest in electronic literature and poetry that I discovered in my undergraduate degree in English literature, I felt compelled to join the MLIS program and in time found myself deeply interested in the technology aspect of the humanities, and in turn opted to do my concentration as a mash-up of sorts between Informatics and Archives, specifically in the digital sphere, as well as deciding to pursue the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate concurrently. </p><p>After enrolling in Introduction to Programming and Data Management in my first quarter of my program, I decided to follow this path further and enrolled in a separate Data Management course as well as Digital Preservation. For the Spring quarter I enrolled in Metadata and Human Computer Interaction to further my comprehension in these areas. As it stands, my desire to deepen my understanding of the digital humanities through information technologies is on the forefront of my efforts at UCLA. For my last quarter in the program, I feel as though I’ve created a course schedule that blends the heart of my concentration into one, between Informatics, Digital Asset Management, and Archival Description and Access. It is my hope upon graduating from UCLA to pursue a career as a Digital Archivist to further interlink these varying fields and be able to notably contribute to the creation, storage, preservation, organization, description, and access of historical materials. </p><p>Through my time in the Digital Humanities Program, I enrolled in both Digital Storytelling and Digital Curation through the Digital Humanities course offerings. In both of these courses I learned how to better establish narratives through the utilzation of digital mediums, and in each course was able to demonstrate that comprehension through my respective culminative final projects. Further, the website development and 3-D modeling I completed through these assignments allowed me to develop practical technical skills that I can implement in my future career endeavors. </p><p>As the field of Digital Humanities continues to grow in our current technological era, so does the responsibility of those that actively participate in it to instigate this disciplines ongoing development. As both an information professional and digital humanist, I believe that the need for information equity must be fully recognized through the dissemination of long-standing boundaries that have halted these endeavors. In expounding upon the values of the humanities within digital mediums and vice versa, the principles of openness, experimentation, collaboration, connectedness, and diversity are able to thrive in parallel to the world at large. </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/digitalresearchportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/digitalresearchportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
